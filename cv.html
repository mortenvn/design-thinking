      <div class="panel">
        <p>Start with your name and personal information. You may add a picture of yourself, but you do not have to.</p>
        <img class="article-image" src="img/articles/cv4.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Start with your most recent education, and work backwards. Include name of school, field of study and any specialization.</p>
        <img class="article-image" src="img/articles/cv5.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Work experience does not only have to be paid work, but can be volunteer work or personal projects. Again, start with the most recent. If you have a lot of work experience, only write down the longest employments and the experience most relevant to the job you are applying to.</p>
        <img class="article-image" src="img/articles/cv6.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>In this part, you can write any other information that can help you get the job. Common points are which languages you know, and how well you know them, any training or courses you have, computer or other skills that are not covered by the other sections, interests or hobbies.</p>
        <img class="article-image" src="img/articles/cv7.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>References are people your potential employer can contact and ask questions about you. This should be a person of authority like a former employer, a teacher or a government worker you have a good relationship with. You should always ask before putting a person down as a reference.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>The whole CV should be between one and two pages. Be confident when writing about your skills, but do not lie or exaggerate. Be as objective as possible - write facts, not opinions.</p>
        <p>Good luck getting a job!</p>
